## Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned features for future releases of the Paulownia dashboard.

### High priority

* Implement the Biomass Flows page with a Sankey diagram showing above vs below ground partitioning and uses (wood sale, compost, discarded).
* Add detailed water and CO₂ pages including variability and climate zone scenarios.
* Build out the Economics page with a price tornado chart and interactive sensitivity sliders.
* Complete the Sensitivity & Compare page to allow side‑by‑side comparison of two scenarios and parameter uncertainty analysis.
* Flesh out the Logistics, Extraction & Products, Substrate & Plates and Cradle‑to‑Gate pages with full metrics and charts.
* Implement the End‑of‑Life pages (Recovery & Coverage, Soil Carbon, Carbon Credits & Cashflow) to model soil projects and credit revenues.

### Medium priority

* Support Monte‑Carlo simulations for uncertainty analysis.
* Add map visualisations to allocate treatable hectares to regions.
* Integrate weather and climate data for more accurate growth modelling.

### Long term

* Allow exporting of scenario runs to external carbon registries.
* Add multi‑language support to the interface and documentation.
* Integrate user authentication and scenario sharing via a backend service.
